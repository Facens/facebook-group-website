# Facebook Group Website Script

This script was built with the Facebook PHP SDK in 2011.
It requires that you create an App on Facebook, in order for you to get APP and APP Secret codes.

The script pulls information from a Facebook group, and displays it anywhere you want, such as:

* Group admin info, group description
* Users posts and shared linked
* Likes and Comments (count and content) - Due to Facebook changes in the API, comment count doesnt work any longer
* Group documents

The script also builds a valid RSS feed, with the latest posts from the group

You can see it in action here [http://it.startupscene.org](http://it.startupscene.org).

## Design

You'll find the original graphics&css as a base for your own.


## Further Dev

Development and bug fixing has been discontinued due to lack of time.
You are free to use and branch the script.
